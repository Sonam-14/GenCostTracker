# GenCostTracker 

GenCostTracker is a simple GenAI usage tracking dashboard that simulates how much you're spending when using prompts with tools like OpenAI or Gemini.

It helps:
- Track how many tokens are used
- Estimate costs
- Show alerts when you're over budget

Built using Streamlit. Great for students, beginners, and hackathon demos.
